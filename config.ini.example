# Path to the system's SSH authentication log file
# - Standard location on many Linux distributions
# - Contains all SSH login attempts, successful or failed
# - Requires appropriate permissions to read (usually needs root/sudo)
# - Can be configured here as it may vary by environment but isn't sensitive

# Number of failed login attempts before triggering an alert
# - Set to 50 as a reasonable baseline for detecting brute force attempts
# - High enough to avoid false positives from legitimate typos
# - Low enough to catch automated attack attempts
# - Belongs in config.ini as it's a tunable parameter, not a secret
threshold = 50

# Location where the tool will write its alert logs
# - Separate from system logs for easier analysis
# - Contains detailed information about detected threats
# - Used for historical analysis and incident response
# - Configuration value that may change between environments

# Whitelist entries:
# - 127.0.0.1: Localhost loopback address, always trusted for local testing and development
# - 192.168.1.0/24: Example corporate network range where trusted admin workstations reside
# - Stored in config.ini as these are environment-specific but not sensitive
whitelist = 127.0.0.1, 192.168.1.0/24

# Blacklist entries demonstrate common security controls:
# - Stored in config.ini as these are operational configurations, not secrets
# - May differ between environments but don't need to be hidden
blacklist = 10.0.0.5, 172.16.0.0/16

# Determines how to handle internal (RFC 1918) IP addresses
# - Configuration choice that affects behavior but isn't sensitive
