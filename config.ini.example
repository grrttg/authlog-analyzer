# Minimum AbuseIPDB confidence score that triggers an alert
# - Set to 50 as a reasonable baseline for identifying potentially malicious IPs

# - Belongs in config.ini as it's a tunable parameter, not a secret

# - Supports both individual IPs (127.0.0.1) and CIDR notation (192.168.1.0/24)
# - 127.0.0.1: Localhost loopback address, always trusted for local testing and development
# - 192.168.1.0/24: Example corporate network range where trusted admin workstations reside
# - Stored in config.ini as these are environment-specific but not sensitive

# - Stored in config.ini as these are operational configurations, not secrets
